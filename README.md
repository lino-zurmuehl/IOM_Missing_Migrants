<h2>IOM Missing Migrants Project</h2>
        <p>To practice my leaflet and shinyapp scills I started this small project with the IOM Missing Migrants dataset. 
            I optained the data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-missing-migrants-dataset/data">kaggel</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The dataset encompasses details regarding the fatalities and disappearances of migrants globally. 
            It is meticulously compiled from diverse sources, including IOM field offices, media reports, and surveys. Updated on an annual basis, the dataset spans from 2014 to 2020. Curated by the International Organization for Migration's Missing Migrants Project, this repository serves as a comprehensive database documenting missing and deceased migrants.
        </p>
        <p>
            I created a leaflet map to visualize the data. The map shows the number of incidents reported in the data set. The barplot shows the number of incidents per migration route. The user can select the year, month and the region of interest. The map and the barplot will update accordingly.
        </p>


To DO:
- Set up notebook
- make the migration routes more pretty and based on actual routes from literature
- Decide on distance from the route as being a death on this route
- Update the shiny app
-
